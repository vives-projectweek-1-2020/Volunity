## Git Contributing Guide

**Please follow the instructions to keep the repo clean and merge conflict-free**

To protect the master branch, you can't directly commit to the branch.

Instead, make a new branch `feature-x` and commit all your code there.\
If you want to merge your `feature-x` branch to the master you will need to create a pull request, at least 1 other person needs to review and accept your changes before it can be merged. (via GitHub)\
The merge strategy is squash merging. This means that the master commits only have one commit per feature so that it stays clean. Therefore you can commit as frequently as you want with whatever commit messages in your branch.

Once merged checkout your local repo to master and pull. After this you can create another `feature-y` branch and follow the same process.
